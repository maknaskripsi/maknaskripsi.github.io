                                            I experienced this a few days ago. At the time I went to school with my aunt because we went to the same direction. Aunt Wina rode the motorcycle slowly. There were traffic lights and the light turned red. However, aunt Wina kept riding on, without stopping. I was shocked. I hit her shoulder and said, ”Auntie, why didn’t you stop? The light was red”. My aunt looked shocked and said, “What? Did the light turn red?” Then, she stopped the motorcycle.
“Yeah! Didn’t you know that?” I asked quizzically.
“No….no! In fact, I wanted to turn left. We might turn left although the light was red, right? How could I go straight? What was wrong with me?” she wondered.
“Please calm down, Auntie. You might be thinking of something else. Well let me ride the motorcycle,” I said.
Then, we continued our trip. Auntie and I were very thankful that nothing bad happened. Since then, we were more careful and vigilant.
Indeed, we should not be daydreaming or joking when we are on streets. Negligence leads a disaster.

                                            Best Friend Forever Among many friends that people have, some of them may eventually become true friends. Those who finally become true friends usually have these characteristics. First, true friends have a commitment to their friends' happiness. True friends are consistently willing to put their friends happiness before friendship. True friends will not refrain from telling something that may even risk breaking the friendship for the sake of their friends' happiness. That is because they will not lack the mercy to correct their friends when the friends are wrong. The next characteristic is respect. True friends respect their friends' life principle, and will not ask them to place the friendship before the principle. They will not ask their friends to compromise the principle in the name of friendship or anything else. The last characteristic deals with a good influence. True friends inspire their comrades to live up to their best potential, and not to indulge their friends' best drive. Best friends forever are friends with those traits. In a friendship of people with such characters, people can look forward to having healthy relationship, which is a contributory factor in life happiness Task 2: Questions1.

                                                "Best Friend Forever"Among many friends that people have, some of them may eventually become true friends. Those who finally become true friends usually have these characteristics.First, true friends have a commitment to their friends’ happiness. True friends are consistently willing to put their friends’ happiness before friendship. True friends will not refrain from telling something that may even risk breaking the friendship for the sake of their friends’ happiness. That is because they will not lack the mercy to correct their friends when the friends are wrong.The next characteristic is respect. True friends respect their friends’ life principle, and will not ask them to place the friendship before the principle. They will not ask their friends to compromise the principle in the name of friendship or anything else.The last characteristic deals with a good influence. True friends inspire their comrades to live up to their best potential, and not to indulge their friends’ best drive.Best friends forever are friends with those traits. In a friendship of people with such characters, people can look forward to having healthy relationship, which is a contributory factor in life happiness.Question:1.

                                            Help!!For example, a nervous smile while rejecting an offer during a negotiation wont help you get what you want; it will just make the other person feel uneasy about working with you because theyll assume that youre up to something.4. Turning yourself away from others, or not leaning into your conversation, portrays that you are unengaged, uninterested, uncomfortable, and perhaps even distrustful of the person speaking.Try leaning in towards the person who is speaking and tilt your head slightly as you listen to them speak. This shows the person speaking that they have your complete focus and attention.5. Slouching is a sign of disrespect. It communicates that youre bored and have no desire to be where you are. You would never tell your boss, I dont understand why I have to listen to you, but if you slouch, you dont have toyour body says it for you, loud and clear.The brain is hardwired to equate power with the amount of space people take up. Standing up straight with your shoulders back is a power position. It maximizes the amount of space you fill. Slouching, on the other hand, is the result of collapsing your formit takes up less space and projects less power. Maintaining good posture commands respect and promotes engagement from both ends of the conversation. 6. Avoiding eye contact makes it look like you have something to hide, and that arouses suspicion. Lack of eye contact can also indicate a lack of confidence and interest, which you never want to communicate in a business setting. Sustained eye contact, on the other hand, communicates confidence, leadership, strength, and intelligence. While it is possible to be engaged without direct, constant eye contact, complete negligence will clearly have negative effects on your professional relationships.7. Eye contact thats too intense may be perceived as aggressive, or an attempt to dominate. On average, Americans hold eye contact for seven to ten seconds, longer when were listening than when were talking. The way we break contact sends a message, too. Glancing down communicates submission, while looking to the side projects confidence.8. Watching the clock while talking to someone is a clear sign of disrespect, impatience, and inflated ego. It sends the message that you have better things to do than talk to the person youre with, and that youre anxious to leave them.9. Exaggerated nodding signals anxiety about approval. People may perceive your heavy nods as an attempt to show you agree with or understand something that you actually dont.10. Fidgeting with or fixing your hair signals that youre anxious, over-energized, self-conscious, and distracted. People will perceive you as overly concerned with your physical appearance and not concerned enough with your career.11. Scowling or having a generally unhappy expression sends the message that youre upset by those around you, even if they have nothing to do with your mood. Scowls turn people away, as they feel judged. Smiling, however, suggests that youre open, trustworthy, confident, and friendly. MRI studies have shown that the human brain responds favorably to a person whos smiling, and this leaves a lasting positive impression.12. Weak handshakes signal that you lack authority and confidence, while a handshake that is too strong could be perceived as an aggressive attempt at domination, which is just as bad. Adapt your handshake to each person and situation, but make sure its always firm.13. Getting too close. If you stand too close to someone (nearer than one and a half feet), it signals that you have no respect for or understanding of personal space. This will make people very uncomfortable when theyre around you.Bringing It All TogetherAvoiding these body language blunders will help you form stronger relationships, both professionally and personally.Please share what you have read and understood about the article in english​</a>

                            7. I experienced this a few days ago. At the time I went to school with my aunt because we went to the same direction. Aunt Wina rode the motorcycle slowly. There were traffic lights and the light turned red. However, aunt Wina kept riding on, without stopping. I was shocked. I hit her shoulder and said, ”Auntie, why didn’t you stop? The light was red”. My aunt looked shocked and said, “What? Did the light turn red?” Then, she stopped the motorcycle.
“Yeah! Didn’t you know that?” I asked quizzically.
“No….no! In fact, I wanted to turn left. We might turn left although the light was red, right? How could I go straight? What was wrong with me?” she wondered.
“Please calm down, Auntie. You might be thinking of something else. Well let me ride the motorcycle,” I said.
Then, we continued our trip. Auntie and I were very thankful that nothing bad happened. Since then, we were more careful and vigilant.
Indeed, we should not be daydreaming or joking when we are on streets. Negligence leads a disaster.

                            9. Best Friend Forever Among many friends that people have, some of them may eventually become true friends. Those who finally become true friends usually have these characteristics. First, true friends have a commitment to their friends' happiness. True friends are consistently willing to put their friends happiness before friendship. True friends will not refrain from telling something that may even risk breaking the friendship for the sake of their friends' happiness. That is because they will not lack the mercy to correct their friends when the friends are wrong. The next characteristic is respect. True friends respect their friends' life principle, and will not ask them to place the friendship before the principle. They will not ask their friends to compromise the principle in the name of friendship or anything else. The last characteristic deals with a good influence. True friends inspire their comrades to live up to their best potential, and not to indulge their friends' best drive. Best friends forever are friends with those traits. In a friendship of people with such characters, people can look forward to having healthy relationship, which is a contributory factor in life happiness Task 2: Questions1.

                            18. Help!!For example, a nervous smile while rejecting an offer during a negotiation wont help you get what you want; it will just make the other person feel uneasy about working with you because theyll assume that youre up to something.4. Turning yourself away from others, or not leaning into your conversation, portrays that you are unengaged, uninterested, uncomfortable, and perhaps even distrustful of the person speaking.Try leaning in towards the person who is speaking and tilt your head slightly as you listen to them speak. This shows the person speaking that they have your complete focus and attention.5. Slouching is a sign of disrespect. It communicates that youre bored and have no desire to be where you are. You would never tell your boss, I dont understand why I have to listen to you, but if you slouch, you dont have toyour body says it for you, loud and clear.The brain is hardwired to equate power with the amount of space people take up. Standing up straight with your shoulders back is a power position. It maximizes the amount of space you fill. Slouching, on the other hand, is the result of collapsing your formit takes up less space and projects less power. Maintaining good posture commands respect and promotes engagement from both ends of the conversation. 6. Avoiding eye contact makes it look like you have something to hide, and that arouses suspicion. Lack of eye contact can also indicate a lack of confidence and interest, which you never want to communicate in a business setting. Sustained eye contact, on the other hand, communicates confidence, leadership, strength, and intelligence. While it is possible to be engaged without direct, constant eye contact, complete negligence will clearly have negative effects on your professional relationships.7. Eye contact thats too intense may be perceived as aggressive, or an attempt to dominate. On average, Americans hold eye contact for seven to ten seconds, longer when were listening than when were talking. The way we break contact sends a message, too. Glancing down communicates submission, while looking to the side projects confidence.8. Watching the clock while talking to someone is a clear sign of disrespect, impatience, and inflated ego.

                            19. For example, a nervous smile while rejecting an offer during a negotiation wont help you get what you want; it will just make the other person feel uneasy about working with you because theyll assume that youre up to something.4. Turning yourself away from others, or not leaning into your conversation, portrays that you are unengaged, uninterested, uncomfortable, and perhaps even distrustful of the person speaking.Try leaning in towards the person who is speaking and tilt your head slightly as you listen to them speak. This shows the person speaking that they have your complete focus and attention.5. Slouching is a sign of disrespect. It communicates that youre bored and have no desire to be where you are. You would never tell your boss, I dont understand why I have to listen to you, but if you slouch, you dont have toyour body says it for you, loud and clear.The brain is hardwired to equate power with the amount of space people take up. Standing up straight with your shoulders back is a power position. It maximizes the amount of space you fill. Slouching, on the other hand, is the result of collapsing your formit takes up less space and projects less power. Maintaining good posture commands respect and promotes engagement from both ends of the conversation. 6. Avoiding eye contact makes it look like you have something to hide, and that arouses suspicion. Lack of eye contact can also indicate a lack of confidence and interest, which you never want to communicate in a business setting. Sustained eye contact, on the other hand, communicates confidence, leadership, strength, and intelligence. While it is possible to be engaged without direct, constant eye contact, complete negligence will clearly have negative effects on your professional relationships.7. Eye contact thats too intense may be perceived as aggressive, or an attempt to dominate. On average, Americans hold eye contact for seven to ten seconds, longer when were listening than when were talking. The way we break contact sends a message, too. Glancing down communicates submission, while looking to the side projects confidence.8. Watching the clock while talking to someone is a clear sign of disrespect, impatience, and inflated ego. It sends the message that you have better things to do than talk to the person youre with, and that youre anxious to leave them.9. Exaggerated nodding signals anxiety about approval. People may perceive your heavy nods as an attempt to show you agree with or understand something that you actually dont.10. Fidgeting with or fixing your hair signals that youre anxious, over-energized, self-conscious, and distracted. People will perceive you as overly concerned with your physical appearance and not concerned enough with your career.11.
